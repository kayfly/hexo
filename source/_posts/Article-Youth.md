## Youth

>Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind;
>it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees;
>it is a matter of will, a quality of imagination,a vigor of the emotions;
>it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.
>Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity,
>
> <!-- more --> 
>
>of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.
>This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20.
>Nobody grows old merely by a number of years.
>We grow old by deserting our ideals.
>Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.
>Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.
>Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human beings heart the lure of wonder,
>the unfailing childlike appetite of what’s next and the joy of the game of living.
>In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station:
>so long as it receives messages of beauty,hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the infinite,
>so long as you are young.
>When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism,
>then you are grown old, even at 20,
>but as long as your aerials are up to catch waves of optimism,
>there is hope you may die young at 80.
